# Installing the WhiteBox Mod

1. Open up Terminal, and copy-paste the following code:

```
git --version

If it prompts you to install Git, install it.

If it doesn't download, manually download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).



2. Type the following code into Terminal:

```
cd documents
git clone http://github.com/kwugfighter/whitebox
```



3. Go to `chrome://extensions`, turn on `Developer Mode`, click on `Load Unpacked`, and find the folder named `whitebox`.
