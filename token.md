4. Scroll down, and press `command-R` (or whatever you use to reload with). Watch for a row to pop up, double click the long string of characters next to `token`, and copy. (If it disappears before you manage to copy it, reload and try again).

5. Remove the double quotes (`"`).


# REMEMBER

Treat your token like your password, so only give it to people you trust. If anything goes wrong, however, you can always change your token by changing your Discord password.
